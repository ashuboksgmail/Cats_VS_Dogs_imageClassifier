- Built and trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using TensorFlow/Keras to classify images. 
- Preprocessed a dataset of  images by resizing and organizing them for training and validation. 
- Designed CNN architectures with optimized hyperparameters, achieving improved classification performance. 
- Deployed models to predict unseen images and saved results for future use.
